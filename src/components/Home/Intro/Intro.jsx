        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I am a determined problem solver with in-depth knowledge of the software lifecycle and design patterns. I
          consider understanding the big-picture of a project crucial while staying grounded in my skills and where I
          can provide the most value. I am skilled in identifying and implementing appropriate technical solutions while
          maintaining software craftsmanship throughout each project. In addition, I possess excellent communication and
          critical thinking skills to identify business challenges and immediately prescribe effective technical
          solutions. Finally, I am a natural creative with a passion for creating visually stunning solutions that
          thrive.
